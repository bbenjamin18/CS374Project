**Mobile App Prototype Proposal**

**What is/are the problem/s you want to solve? Please provide background based on research**
Making a dating app that is inclusive for those on the asexuality spectrum. Asexuality remains poorly understood by the public at large, and includes a broad spectrum of orientations. Although OKCupid stands alone in acknowledging those who are asexual, asexual people still face the limitation of mainstream dating servies.

**Who are the users you are targeting? Please use a Persona to describe your users and draw a picture of your target user.**
Noelle is a college student who is demisexual and demiromantic. Because of this, she often finds it difficult to meet people she’s interested in. Surface level dating apps like Tinder don’t work for her because she has to get to know the person first before she develops interest. She would like to find an app where she can meet people who she has common interests with.
 
**What are the major features of the solution? List the features.**
        Specifying specific gender sexuality
        Interest groups /chats
        Inclusivity
 
**How is this solution unique? How does it relate to existing solutions on the market? What are three solutions similar or related to what you want to do in the Google Play Store? Do the research and know that you are probably not reinventing the wheel! Present these three solutions, a description and how they compare to yours. Provide screenshots of the existing solutions.**
This solution is unique because it allows users to identify on the asexuality spectrum, which isn’t a part of many dating apps. Additionally, the chat feature will allow users to talk to more people at once, which alleviates the pressure of talking to people one on one. Once the user is comfortable with someone they meet in the group, they can then communicate with them privately outside of it.
**What technologies, APIs etc will you be using to develop this solution? Provide links and explanations.**
Android studios (https://developer.android.com/studio), firebase, (https://firebase.google.com/)...  More will be added and expanded on as we find, learn, and apply them.
